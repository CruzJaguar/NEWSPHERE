## Development Model

### Incremental Model
**Reasoning:**  
The Incremental model is well-suited for the Babcock University Online News Channel, allowing for a phased development and release of features. This approach begins with a functional core, such as basic news article display and user authentication, enabling a quick initial launch. Subsequent increments introduce features like comment sections, search functionality, and live broadcasts, adapting to evolving user needs and feedback. This iterative process allows for continuous testing and validation, ensuring stability and reliability as the platform grows. By delivering smaller, manageable pieces of functionality, the incremental model reduces development complexity and risk, facilitating efficient resource allocation and a more adaptable approach to meeting the dynamic demands of a university news environment.
